# AlarmClock-project
The project encompasses a Digital Alarm Clock that allows users to establish multiple alarms. Initially, the project features a digital clock that consistently updates itself every second. In the subsequent phase, users can set alarms, which are then appended to a list below and subsequently triggered at the designated time. Alongside each newly set alarm, a delete button is provided. Upon clicking this button, users can deactivate the alarm and eliminate it from the webpage.

# Approach
An array will be utilized to store all set alarms. Each second, the array will be examined to determine if the current time matches any of the alarms. If a match is found, the alarm sound will be triggered. Clicking the "Stop alarm" button will pause the audio, while selecting the "Delete Alarm" option will remove the specific alarm from both the array and the list.
